# Forum Software by MiataBoy
This is supposed to be an experimental attempt at creating my own forum software with PHP, Javascript. MySQL, and more.
I cannot guarantee that this'll end up looking good at all (because CSS is not my strongest suite either) but i will keep building and learning to improve it.

## Planned features:
- Subforums
- Threads with posts
- Markdown in posts
- Image insertion
- User Profiles
- User tags
- User roles (moderator, administrator)
- User blocking/banning
- User warning
- Private conversations

More is to come after implementing the basics such as this.
